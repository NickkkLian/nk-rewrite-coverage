description: After rewriting a long document — a spec, a research report, a handbook — list what the old version had that the new one no longer mentions, and account for every item with a three-state verdict before the rewrite is accepted. Use when an agent rewrote instead of edited, after a context compaction, when a "clean-up" made a file shorter, or when a reviewer suspects detail was lost. scripts/rewrite_coverage.py extracts headings, bold terms and table cells from the old text and reports the unaccounted ones; a percentage is never the criterion, the ledger is. Not a diff tool.

# Rewrite coverage

**A rewrite is a retelling from memory, and memory keeps conclusions and drops process.** A 630-line
analysis rewritten after a context compaction came back as 755 lines that read fine — and had lost eight
reasoning chains compressed into one, a timetable, five verbatim quotations, a placement table and a
cross-reference section, six whole blocks. Nothing in the new text said anything was missing. The parts
that vanish are exactly the ones a reader needs to check or reuse the work.

> **Paths.** Commands in this skill start with `${…SKILL_DIR}`: this skill's own folder, the one that contains this SKILL.md. Claude Code fills it in. If your agent shows the placeholder as written (Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI and others), replace it with that folder's absolute path before you run the command. Left as it is, it expands to nothing and the path breaks.

## When this applies

- The new file replaced the old one instead of patching it (an agent "cleaned up", "restructured",
  "rewrote for clarity", or resumed after compaction).
- The new file is shorter, or the diff is the whole file.
- The document is one people rely on for detail: specs, research, procedures, handbooks.

## Procedure

1. Keep the old version (git has it: `git show HEAD:path > /tmp/old.md`).
2. `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/rewrite_coverage.py old.md new.md --out unaccounted.md`
   prints every heading, bold term and table cell of the old text that does not occur in the new, plus
   structure hints (headings / table rows / quote lines / character count, old → new).
3. **Read the hints first.** New text under 60% of the old characters: check for truncation before
   anything else. Old had headings, new has none: the rewrite kept the words and lost the structure.
4. **Give every unaccounted item one verdict** in a ledger file (one line each, the item text followed
   by a tag): `[renamed]` same content, other words · `[merged]` folded into another section ·
   `[restored]` it was lost and you put it back · `[dropped]` removed on purpose, with the reason.
5. `rewrite_coverage.py old.md new.md --ledger ledger.md` exits 0 only when every item has a tag.
   Commit the ledger with the rewrite; it is the record of what this revision did to the previous one.
6. Anything tagged `[restored]`: restore it verbatim from the old file, not from memory.

## Why not a percentage

The existence test only asks whether the characters occur somewhere in the new text. Measured on real
rewrites: a "term dump" (every old term pasted into a list, no analysis, no quotations, no sections) scored
92%; an honest rewrite scored 51% because it renamed things. High does not mean nothing was lost; low does
not mean something was. The only output that carries information is the list, and the only criterion is
that each line on it has a human verdict.

## What it cannot see

- Content moved to the wrong section (the words exist, the place is wrong).
- A change in any other cell of a table row: each row is compared by one cell, the first, or the second
  when the first column only counts the rows (1, 2, 3 … in order). Codes and ids in a first column (200, #123)
  are compared as they are.
- Quotations that are no longer verbatim — compare those against the source, not against the old draft.
- A new file that is complete and wrong.
- Truncation of the new file is hinted by the character ratio only; confirm the file ends where it should.

## Provenance

Own practice, 2026-08: the compaction rewrite described above, followed by four rounds of an auditor
breaking the first version of this tool (a positive probe that was always true; a percentage that a term
dump could game; a truncated file that still scored mid-range). The tool was then demoted from a gate to
a list generator with a ledger rule. No external source.
